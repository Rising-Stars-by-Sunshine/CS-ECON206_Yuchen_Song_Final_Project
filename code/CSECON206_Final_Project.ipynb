        "The game is based on a classical game in game theory literature, Chicken Game, which is a model of conflict between risk-taking and risk-avoidance of two players. One of the classical game scenarios is when two drivers drive toward each other, each can choose to swerve or straight. If one of them chooses to swerve and the other chooses to straight, the former one will be seen as chickening out and will receive a lower payoff (2), while the latter one will receive a higher payoff (7) since he is braver. If both choose to swerve, it will be a tie, and both receive a moderate payoff (6,6). While, if both players choose to straight, they will crash into each other, and receives a zero payoff, since they fail to avoid the risk. In the modified version, one additional rule is that both players can choose whether to spy at the beginning of the game, if so, he will pay 1 payoff at last. The game has two rounds, and the total payoff is the sum of the payoff in two rounds."

Because if one player uses spies, and he knows his opponent will chooses swerve, he must choose straight to maximize his own payoff. Meanwhile, if the opponent knows that the player uses spies, he may choose straight to retaliate this distrust behavior. Therefore, the equilibrium is unstable."
