# # Modified Chicken Game under a Spy Operation Scenario
## Project information
- **Author**: Yuchen Song, Computation and Design with tracks in Computer Science, 2025, Duke Kunshan University
- **Instructor**: Prof. Luyao Zhang, Duke Kunshan University
- **Disclaimer**: Submissions to the Problem Set No. or Final Project for [COMPSCI/ECON 206 Computational Microeconomics, 2023 Spring (Seven Week - Second)](https://ce.pubpub.org/) instructed by Prof. Luyao Zhang at Duke Kunshan University.
- **Project Summary**: 
  - Summarize the Background/Motivation: Nash equilibrium is based on the assumption that players are rational, but in reality, players are sometimes willing to take risks to maximize profit. For example, in Chicken Game, the solution obtained by using Nash equilibrium is that both sides choose chicken, but one side may bet that the opposite side is rational and will choose chicken. Based on this risky assumption, he will choose Dave to maximize his own payoff. Therefore, based on the discussion of spy in the Art of War, this paper proposes a solution concept to avoid irrational self-interest maximization and increase the probability to choose a Nash equilibrium strategy.
  - Research Questions: 1. Are there some ways to force both players to be perfectly rational in the game, ultimately increasing the probability that the players will choose the Nash equilibrium? 2. How will people act in the modified Chicken Game? What are their rationales? 3. Can the additional rules in the game influence people’s decision-making and force them to avoid risk-taking choices and choose the Nash equilibrium?
  - Application Scenario: The modified Chicken Game can be applied to situations involving conflicts or interactions between two sides where risk-taking and risk-avoidance are key elements. Examples includes business negotiations, military deterrence and political game. 
  - Methodology:The game is based on a classical game in game theory literature, Chicken Game, which is a model of conflict between risk-taking and risk-avoidance of two players. In the modified version, one additional rule is that both players can choose whether to spy at the beginning of the game, if so, he will pay 1 payoff at last. The game has two rounds, and the total payoff is the sum of the payoff in two rounds.
  - Results: Based on the modified game and the analysis of all strategies, the optimal strategy is not the one suggested by Nash Equilibrium.
  - Intellectual Merits and Practical impacts: Experiment verifications, a more complex game environment containing spy actions, extension to other strategic form games, and psychological and behavioral studies are future research directions based on this research
